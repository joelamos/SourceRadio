# SourceRadio

SourceRadio makes it possible for players on a server to build a playlist together and listen to music as they playâ€”even on public servers.

SourceRadio plays music through the owner's ingame microphone, and songs may be requested by any player via the chat interface. If multiple songs are requested within a short time span, the first song plays, and the others are placed in a queue.

Your selection of music is practically infinite. That's because SourceRadio streams music directly from YouTube. When players request a song, SourceRadio takes the request and sends it to YouTube, which spits out the top result. SourceRadio stores the information gathered from each song request in a local database, using that information to avoid future lookups. SourceRadio also saves the most-requested songs locally to the owner's drive in order to stream songs more efficiently.

## Supported games

* **Team Fortress 2**
* **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive**
* **Left 4 Dead 2**

## System requirements

* SourceRadio was developed to run on **Windows Vista** and above.
* Must have **Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or above** installed. Download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).
* A **good, low-latency Internet connection**. A bad Internet connection may cause SourceRadio to crash. It may also provide an unpleasant listening experience for teammates.

**Note**: A physical microphone is not required for sharing music with teammates.

## Installation & usage

 1. Join the [SourceRadio Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/source-radio) and download the  installer from the link on that page.
 1. Run the installer, and carefully follow all of the instructions it gives. *Note: Anti-malware software may flag the installer because it is not from a known source. You may have to temporarily disable this software.*
 1. Become familiar with all of SourceRadio's [commands](#ingame-commands). Then, open the [properties.txt](#propertiestxt) file and ensure that each value is correct for you.
 1. Run SourceRadio alongside a [supported game](#supported-games) and begin jamming to tunes.

## Ingame commands

Commands are issued to SourceRadio by players via the ingame chat interface. The owner also has the option of issuing commands via the developer console if he uses underscore for spaces. Commands are only recognized if they appear at the beginning of the message and start with an exclamation point.

Below, an asterisk indicates that a command has the ability to write changes to the properties file. This is done by appending `-w` to the end of such a command (e.g. `!queue-limit-w 7`). Parameters are indicated here in square brackets. However, when commands are issued, brackets do not surround the parameters.

* **!song** [YouTube query] - Used to request the playing of a song. This is the only non-admin command.
* <a name="skip-command"></a>**!skip** - Skips the song that is currently playing and starts the next song if there is one in the queue.
* <a name="ignore-command"></a>**!ignore** [optional request index `n`] - Ensures that the `n`th-to-last `!song` command is ignored (whether or not it would have been ignored automatically). The last `!song` command is ignored if no argument is provided.
* **!extend** - Removes the [duration limit property](#duration-limit-property) from a song. Extended songs play until they are finished unless they are skipped or ignored.
* <a name="alltalk-command"></a>**!alltalk*** [`on` or `off`] - Sets whether chat binds send messages to both teams or only the owner's team. After this command is executed, the binds script must be re-executed via the [reload script bind](#reload-script-bind-property). | [See property](#alltalk-property)
* **!clear** - Removes all songs from the queue and stops the song that is currently playing.
* **!add-admin*** [username] - Adds the specified player as an admin. | See [admins.txt](#adminstxt)
* **!remove-admin*** [username] - Removes the specified player from the list of admins. This command may only be issued by the owner, and the owner may not specify himself.
* <a name="duration-limit-command"></a>**!duration-limit*** [number of seconds] - Sets the number of seconds that songs are allowed to play if there are songs in the queue. | [See property](#duration-limit-property)
* <a name="player-song-limit-command"></a>**!player-song-limit*** [number of songs] - Sets the number songs that a given player is allowed to have playing or in the queue at a time. | [See property](#player-song-limit-property)
* <a name="queue-limit-command"></a>**!queue-limit*** [number of songs] - Sets the total number of songs allowed in the queue at a time. | [See property](#queue-limit-property)
* **!ban*** [username] - Bans the specified player from issuing commands. | See [banned players.txt](#banned-playerstxt)
* **!unban*** [username] - Unbans the specified player so that he may issue commands once again.
* **!block-song*** [request index *n* **or** song title] - Ensures that the song referenced by the `n`th-to-last `!song` command **or** by the specified song title is never allowed  to play. If the referenced song is playing or queued upon being blocked, it gets terminated. If `n = 0`, the currently playing song gets blocked. If no argument is provided, the song referenced by the last `!song` command gets blocked. | See [blocked songs.txt](#blocked-songstxt)
* **!unblock-song*** [song title] - Revokes the previous block that was placed on the specified song.
* <a name="vocals-command"></a>**!vocals*** [`on` or `off`]- Sets whether or not there should be an artificial vocalization every time a command is issued. | [See property](#vocals-property)
* <a name="stop-command"></a>**!stop** - Closes the MySQL server and stops SourceRadio. This command should always be issued when the owner is done running SourceRadio.

## Properties

The various files containing properties and settings for configuring SourceRadio are located at `...\SourceRadio\properties`. Below, you will find explanations of each important file in this directory that you may want to tweak to fit your preferences. You may use `//` to demarcate comments in these files.

### properties.txt

This file contains SourceRadio's main parameters. Property-value pairs are separated by the delimiter ` -> `. See [this list](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting#List_of_key_names) for valid key names for binding. To restore this file's default values, run `restore defaults.bat`.

### admins.txt

If you wish, you may use this file to grant administrative privileges to specified players. Admins are able to execute most of the available [ingame commands](#ingame-commands). This allows them to complete tasks that normal players can't, such as skipping songs and banning players.

This file should contain the Steam ID (any format) or profile URL of each player you wish to make an admin, with each value on its own line. Alternatively, you can add admins using the ingame `!add-admin [username]` command, so long as the player is on the same server with you.

**Note**: As the owner, you do not have to place your ID in this file to grant yourself privileges.

### banned players.txt

If you wish, you may use this file to revoke the ability for certain players to request songs. 

This file should contain the Steam ID (any format) or profile URL of each player you wish to ban, with each value on its own line. Alternatively, you can ban players using the ingame `!ban [username]` command, so long as the player is on the same server with you.

### blocked songs.txt

If you wish, you may use this file to block certain songs from being played. 

This file should contain a list of the YouTube IDs for each song you wish to block. Each ID must be on its own line.  Alternatively, you can block songs using the ingame `!block-song [song-title]` command.

**Note**: The YouTube ID `mOF17bfG0Do` corresponds to the YouTube URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOF17bfG0Do`.

## Program arguments

 * `-g` takes the name of the game you are playing as an argument. This command is mandatory.
     * `tf2` for Team Fortress 2
     * `csgo` for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

 * `-f` takes a file path as an argument. This command specifies the path to the game directory if the game is not in the default location.
 * `-l` takes a file path as an argument. This command runs SourceRadio but listens to the specified file for commands rather than the game log. This command is for debugging only.
 * `-d` restores the properties in `properties.txt` to their default values without running SourceRadio.

## FAQs

#### Why can't I run the installer? / / My computer thinks this a virus!
Some anti-malware software may flag the installer because it comes from an unknown source. You may have to temporarily disable this software in order to run the installer.

#### Why does music keep playing after I've finished?
You most likely forgot to use the [!stop command](#stop-command) when you finished. You can stop the audio playback by going to the **Task Manager**, clicking **More details**, selecting **AudioController.exe**, and clicking **End task**.
